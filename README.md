1. This repo comes inpackage with foundation utility classes for easier development.ry to use as much as possible.
2. Media Queries importing from rootStyles is recommended.
3 Use <If />, <Else /> from utility in jsx for conditional rendering in jsx,
4. on making new component try to make a folder, file name and class but import and export from index.scss ===> this helps in debugging and makes relative routes better.
5 Default 1 point spaving is 1 rem.. Try to use rem as much as possible.
